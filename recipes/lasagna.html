    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, is a
        type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is
        made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel
        sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The
        dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with
        the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or
        rectangular portions.</p>

        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>800g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2tsp driedoregano</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>40g flour</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>1/4tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>150g lasagna noogles</li>
        <li>60g parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the lasagna recipe, peel and finely chop garlic. Peel and dice the onion and carrots. Heat a little olive oil in
            a large pan and fry the onions, carrots and garlic. Add the minced beef and brown evenly, using a wooden spoon to
            break it up as you go. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Then add the chopped tomatoes and season again with
            salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over a medium heat for approx. 15–20 min. Stir in the dried oregano.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven for the lasagna to 200°C/390°F fan or 220°C/430°F top/bottom heat. For the béchamel sauce, melt the
            butter in a small saucepan. Add the flour and brown while stirring. Gradually add the cold milk, stirring
            constantly, then reduce the heat and cook for approx. 5–8 min. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover the base of the casserole dish with olive oil and then with a layer of béchamel. Now layer the lasagna sheets
            first, then the Bolognese and béchamel sauce in succession. Repeat until all the ingredients have been used up,
            finishing with béchamel on top.</li>
        <li>Grate the Parmesan over the last layer, transfer the lasagna to the preheated oven on the middle shelf and bake for
            approx. 30–40 min., or until the top is golden. Serve in the hot oven dish.</li>
